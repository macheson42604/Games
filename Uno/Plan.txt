Let's think about this

Goal: Make the game of Uno

Objectives
- All base rules of Uno should apply. No rules should be eligible to be broken by any player (automated or user).
- All of my favorite bonus rules of Uno should be playable as well :D. 
- You should be able to choose how many opponents you can play against (within game rules).
- There should be a terminal version as well as a graphic displayable version.

Structure
- I love me some Object-Oriented Programming. Objects:
    - Card
        - string: color
        - char: id
        - int: number id (if applicable)
    - Player
        - vector<Card>: hand
        - bool: skipped
        - int: extraDraw
        - bool: out
        - Player*: nextPlayer
    - GamePlay(main)
        - int: numPlayers
        - Player*: curPlayer
        - bool: rules_check()
        - void: end_game()
